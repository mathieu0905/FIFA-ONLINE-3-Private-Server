# FO3ID Private Server

**English** | [Bahasa Indonesia](README.id.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [ไทย](README.th.md) | [Tiếng Việt](README.vi.md) | [한국어](README.ko.md)

**New:** FIFA Online 4's 25 LIVE and 26 LIVE cards as two new seasons (stats as +0, FO4's traits and season badges), with 26 LIVE as the default season. See `tools/fo4_season.py`.

A local private server for **FIFA Online 3 Indonesia** (Garena, client build 654420), written in
Python. Garena shut the official servers down on 2020-06-30; this project re-implements the
backend the client talks to, so the game can be played offline on one PC.

> Not affiliated with EA, Spearhead or Garena. This repository contains **no game files** (no
> client, database, assets or music) — you need your own FO3 ID install. It does **not** include,
> modify or circumvent the client's anti-cheat (XIGNCODE3 / HackShield); that is out of scope.
> Built for game preservation and research.

## What works

Tested in the real client (Indonesian UI):

- Login → manager select / create (club picker over 501 licensed clubs) → lobby (FREEROAM).
- **Single → Liga** (full season: calendar, matches, table, rewards, promotion) and **Cup**
  (draw, groups, knock-out, extra time, penalties).
- **Market** (buy / sell; a card's price follows its rating and grade: the median fifaaddict
  price of all cards with that rating), **Upgrade** (grade +1…+10), **Tukar** and
  **Tukar Scout** player trades (every Market card, not only the region's licensed ones),
  Tim inti / Tim Cadangan, squad and tactics saving.
- **Shop** with every tab (player packs, consumables, packages, MP Shop, monthly and chained
  packages, special bonus), pack opening with random grades, Item saya, Bag, daily login reward.
  **Gudang** (Item saya > Gudang): move packs and consumables there and back.
  Extra packs: **All Season +8** (any season, +1…+8) and one pack for '07 and every season
  fifaaddict lists.
- Always VIP + official PC warnet (IGR) perks, manager delete / restore, season '17 cards.
- Formation list (the club's own + the game's 33 common formations, read from the client's
  formations table) and manager / player levels: EXP after every match, player LV.1-23
  (+1 to every attribute per level), manager LV.1-100.
- Game sound and the EA Trax menu music. `tools/eatrax_song.py` puts your own song first in it,
  but the game then crashes after matches (see the known issue below).
- Admin web page on http://127.0.0.1:8088/ (EP, players, packs, gifts, daily rewards, match rewards, match settings, economy, AI chat, Shop, log)
  with a language switch (issue #15): Bahasa Indonesia, English, 简体中文, ไทย, Tiếng Việt, 한국어;
  the browser remembers the choice.
- Real club kits in matches (kit id = `teamid << 5 | type`; the old `<< 10` gave a checkerboard).
- Matches play through the second half with **team color** on (season colors used to crash it at
  half time), then show the EXP and reward screens.

Added, passing the tests but not yet checked in the client:

- **Team color** bonus itself: the starting XI gets an OVR bonus for players from the same club
  (4-5 players +1 up to 10-11 +4), nation or season (5-6 +1 up to 9-11 +3); per player only the
  best one counts.
- **Opsi > Kontrol** (keyboard and gamepad keys) is saved: the server always sends the game's own
  default key layout, so the screen can apply and save changes (it used to drop them).
- **Kit choice** on the game setting screen (home / away per side) is kept for the match.
- **Manager select** shows the club's most valuable player in the club's kit (it showed the
  game's default Barcelona player).
- Fixed crashes: the startup notice popup (empty web URL), the Beginner's Guide league tutorial
  (missing script).
- **Upgrade chance**: a base chance by target grade, times the "Rasio bonus keberhasilan" label
  the Upgrade tab shows from the material's grade (Kosong x1, Low x1.1, Normal x1.25,
  High x1.5). A failed upgrade from +5 or higher drops one grade.
- **Top 200 packs**: the extra packs now give their season's 200 best cards ("17 Top 200",
  "07 Top 200", …); **All Season Top 300 +8** gives any season's cards rated 81 and up.
- **Upgrade with a +0 card** (issue #5): a club's own +0 card keeps the target's grade at 100%
  (+4 with +0 stays +4) and a +10 may take one; the kept card leaves Tim Cadangan when it takes
  the used card's squad slot.
- **Upgrade 2.5** (the client's newer Upgrade screen, `features...enhancement.v2_5`):
  - **upgrade points**: a failed upgrade grants points; "Gunakan poin" spends them for +10%;
    buy more free in Shop > Paket (Upgrade Point 100 / 500 / 1.000);
  - **boost items** Enhancement Boost Gold / Silver / Bronze (+15 / +10 / +5%), free in
    Shop > Dapat dikonsumsi;
  - a permanent **upgrade event** (+10% for targets +1…+9, `GET /events`);
  - "Coba pengembalian lagi" gives back a grade lost to a failure, for points.
- **Tukar v2** (`trade2`): a trade is rated by its value (TP) in 15 levels, each with a maximum
  offer grade; the tab shows what another manager got "yesterday" at that level; legend-season
  cards count 1.5x; no daily or value limit. Tukar Scout keeps working beside it.
- **Tukar Scout**: the client's two other scouts, Scout Khusus (event; legend-season quest) and
  VVIP Scout (best offers; 1 billion EP quest). Scout Amatir is gone so the list fits its 5 rows
  (once it scrolled, a met quest lit another scout's card or none).
- **Upgrade team colors** (the client's "Upgraded Team"): starters of grade +2, +5 or +8 and
  higher; 5-6 / 7-8 / 9-11 of them give +1 / +2 / +3, +2 / +3 / +4 and +3 / +4 / +5 OVR. The
  single-grade ones ("+3 club" … "+10 Golden summit") need all 11 starters at that grade or higher:
  +4 (club +3/+4), +5 (silver +5…+7), +6 (Golden passion +8/+9), +7 (Golden summit +10). A
  player gets his best upgrade color on top of his best club / nation / season color.
- **Every team color the client names** (188 now):
  - 27 clubs (Real Madrid … Jeonbuk): Single team's tiers plus the club's own boost from the
    game's tooltip, e.g. Barcelona MF agility +3;
  - 30 nations: Satu Negara's tiers plus e.g. Spanyol MF ball control +2;
  - season colors under the game's names (World Best up to +5, World Legend, 2014 WC All-Star, …);
  - about 75 specials: '14 WC and EC per nation, nation BEST, MSN / BBC Trio, Arsenal
    Invincibles, Galácticos, LEGENDS, the TOP 100s, Power Header, New Star, ….

  The original boosts and player lists were server data and are gone. Player lists come from the
  player database (season, club, named players, stat limits); boosts come from the one tooltip
  line the game still has. Left out: the [Test] colors, "+2~7", "14 WC Single Nation" and four
  duplicate club entries.
- **Formasi** no longer opens with "Tidak cukup pemain" (it loads preset squad 1, which the
  server never sent). A hole in the XI (issue #7, an upgrade of two starters of one player) is
  filled from the bench, and the bench never holds a second card of a player. Every starter gets
  his `starting` data (workrate and pitch spot): without it the game shows him on the bench.
- **Tim > Peran** saves the captain and each set-piece taker (issue #8: `PUT /game/my/team/captain`
  and `/game/my/team/kickers/<0-4>` were missing). The five kicker slots (left corner, right
  corner, free kick, penalty, free kick 2) keep their place; an empty one takes a starter.
- **Tim > Locker room** works (issue #13): shirt style and sleeves, tattoo, wristband, gloves
  (keepers: 39 glove designs), socks, knee pads, 614 boots by brand, and shirt numbers (taking
  a number swaps it with its wearer). The item table `/static/db/LOCKERROOMITEM` was missing, so
  every list was empty and the boots panel broke. A player's look is saved on the card, and
  Item saya holds a permanent locker room ticket, which the game needs to show the look in matches.
  Only the client's own wristband, glove and knee pad models are offered (one of each).
- **Shop control on the admin page** (issue #10): every Shop tab (player packs, consumables,
  packages, monthly packages, Featured, MP Shop, Special bonus, chained packages). New packs (by
  season, top N, OVR, max grade, position, league), random boxes, EP cards, packages and monthly
  packages, with any of the client's 147 shop icons. Built-in products can be changed, hidden or
  given a fixed price, and the whole Shop can be made free or not. Changes go to
  `gamedata/shop.json`.
- **Simulasi Liga** coupon (item 2001, Shop > Dapat dikonsumsi): Liga's Simulasi button gives a
  match result without playing, one coupon per match. The simulation screen plays the match's goals,
  shots, saves and cards, matching the result (`eventlist` was empty, so it showed 0-0), and the
  result screen after it shows the score, player ratings and stats, possession and MOTM (it was blank),
  then the EP reward and back to the Liga menu. The button counts the coupons in Item saya
  and stayed off because the item did not exist. New coupons can be made on the admin page (type
  "Kupon Simulasi Liga").
- **Pre-match squad screen** (Liga and Cup, issue #16): swaps, subs and formation changes now
  stick and are saved to the club (`PUT /match/<id>/side/<side>/squad` had no handler, so each
  change undid itself). The formation list is filled, and the stamina bars show full (no fatigue
  is kept between matches).
- **Team FW / MF / DF ratings match the players** (issue #18): on the squad screens and in the lobby
  they are the average of the ratings the player list shows (rating at the player's slot plus
  upgrade grade, level and team color). They were built from the bare card ratings, about 12 lower.
- **Rekor liga tabs** (issue #19): the standings table shows (its tab broke on the missing
  `league2difficulty` table, which now also decides who goes up or down at season end). Rekorku
  lists each player's matches, rating, goals, assists, passes, tackles and saves from the season's
  played matches, and Rekor gabungan shows the season's best XI and stat leaders. Only my own
  players are counted, and simulated matches add no player stats.
- **Squad A / B / C in Formasi** (issue #20): the box left of the formation button picks one of
  three saved squads (it was empty: the server sent no squad count). Each squad keeps its own XI,
  formation and roles.
- **Controller and camera settings stay in matches** (issue #21): after Opsi > Konfirmasi the game
  reads the saved options back from the reply, which had none, so every match put back the options
  from login (keyboard, old camera). In a match, F3-F9 switch the camera (F5 = Co-op).
- **Ganti tim shows the club and your player** (issue #23): the item's club screen now shows the
  league, rival, stadium, year built and capacity, and your player in the new club's kit with
  birth date, height and weight. The server's club info had none of these, and without the kit
  the 3D player was never drawn.
- **Camera height and zoom can be changed** (issue #24): in Opsi > Kamera setting the Customise gauges
  (height and zoom; zoom, speed and swing for the Pro camera) had no value and could not be
  changed, because the server sent an empty camera setting. They now start at 10 (of 20).
- **Every national team in Tim lain** (issue #24): the International league (the last nation in
  the list) has 40 national teams, Italy, England, Germany, Spain and France among them. A
  national team's squad comes from each player's national-team link; before, only teams whose
  players had no licensed club were listed.
- **Player positions on the result screen** (issue #26): after a match the result screen's pitch
  stacked every player at the goal, because the game reports all of them as goalkeepers. The
  server now gives each player the position of their squad slot.
- **Reward cards after a match** (issue #26): the reward screen's cards were empty. Now three
  cards are dealt: the one you pick gives EP (1,000 to 10,000), a player pack (Semua Pemain or
  '14 Top 200) or a Lucky EP item, and the other two show what you could have got.
- **Draft packs and EXP capsules** (issue #27): Shop > Pak pemain sells draft packs ("06 Draft Pick 3",
  "2017 Draft Pick 5", "World Legend Draft Pick 3"). "Gunakan" opens the player picker, filled with the
  season's most valuable cards; pick N cards of that season (search by name, league or club) and one of
  them is opened. Shop > Dapat dikonsumsi sells EXP capsules (1,000, 5,000, Max = LV.23, one for LV.10
  and below, one for 2017 cards): pick a player and he gets the EXP. The draft screen's requests
  (`/item/draftpack/<id>/players/<n>`, `/transfer/price/default/<grade>`) and the capsule item type were
  missing. The admin page makes more of both (a pack's "Draft" field, item type "EXP Capsule").
- **Multiple > Rank: other managers and real matches** (issue #30): the ranked screen stopped on a UI
  error, as the server sent no divisions, rewards or ladder record. It now opens, and virtual managers
  fill its rankings: the top 3 (VS Manager Top) and a friends ranking of 20, each with a name, a club,
  a division and a record that moves through the day as they play. 100 start and 0-3 newcomers join
  every day, up to 300. Each one plays his own style (possession, counter, high press, long ball, park
  the bus or all-out attack: formation, tactics and runs) in his club's kit, with random cards of any
  club and season around his rating, each card at its own grade (+1 for beginners up to +6 and more)
  and level. From day to day they buy and sell cards, upgrade them (a failed upgrade from +5 drops a
  grade) and level them up. Rank 1 on 1 and VS Manager play a real match against one of the five
  managers nearest your rating: squad screen, game setting, then a full match with the game's AI on
  his side, then the result, the rewards and your new rank rating, shown in the Rank screen's panels,
  in the record window (last matches, the season graph) and in Info Manager's match list. During the
  match he chats in the match chat in his own personality (kick-off, goals both ways, missed shots,
  saves, and answers when you type) and has a word on the result back on the Rank screen; the admin
  page's AI chat tab turns it off or picks its language (Indonesian, English, Vietnamese). The
  Messenger opens (it waited for a notification list the server never sent) and shows the 20 friends
  online, busy (in a Rank game) or offline by the hours they play (08:00-02:00 WIB); a friend's Info
  button shows his profile and squad.
- **The Market lives** (issue #30): virtual managers buy the cards you list ("Dijual" turns "Terjual"
  on its own within a few minutes, sooner when cheaper, with a "terjual seharga" toast and a
  notification naming the buyer; Batal and Ulang work) and list cards of their own beside the +1..+3
  stock, other grades too, a little under the market price, with the Kuantitas changing every hour.
  The card window's Market Price tab draws the last 30 days' price.
- **Economy settings** (issue #30): the admin page's new Ekonomi tab makes the game as hard as you
  like: player and pack price multipliers, a new manager's EP, the Shop's free switch, and a dynamic
  Market. There each player's price drifts day by day (up to about 13% either way), virtual managers
  now and then list bargains, and you may ask up to 105% of the price (buyers take longer), so buying
  low and selling high pays. Presets: Easy (as before: free Shop, fixed prices), Realistic (a paid
  Shop at the cards' worth, the dynamic Market, 300,000 starting EP) and Hard (prices x2, 100,000
  EP). Match EP stays on the Match rewards tab.
  While the Shop is paid, nothing makes EP by itself: an Upgrade costs what it adds on average (a
  restore costs EP), a Tukar or Scout offer is worth at most the cards given, a League Simulation
  coupon costs what its round pays, and with the dynamic Market a pack costs its cards' worth at
  their dearest (+13%), as it can be opened on any day.
  Items with no EP in them (boosts, upgrade points, EXP capsules, a name or team change) have a set
  price times the player price setting, so Hard doubles it.
  A change reaches a running game: the server tells it to drop the Shop list it keeps for the
  session, so a Shop tab shows the new prices the next time it opens; a tab already opened since the
  game started keeps its old prices until the game restarts. The Shop's limited-stock check no longer
  ends in "Kesalahan UI telah terjadi".
- **Ten times the AI chat** (issue #30): the virtual managers' chat has 20 lines for every moment and
  personality in each language, 2,700 in all: small talk and football talk at kick-off, reactions to
  goals, misses and saves, banter when you type, and a word on the result. No line holds a word the
  game's chat filter would hide (it also hides them inside longer words).
- **Pre-match settings** (issue #31): Multiple > Rank's game setting screen has working steppers for
  the stadium (the 70 stadiums the client has complete), the time of day (day or night), the weather
  (clear, rain, snow, overcast: dusk at night), the match length (6, 8, 10 or 12 minutes) and the ball
  (9 balls). The last choice is kept for the next matches, Liga and Cup included; their pre-match
  screen only shows the values, so the admin page's new Match settings tab sets them too, also as
  "home team's stadium" or "random". The server fixes two labels in the client's Indonesian strings
  (day read "Waktu", overcast "Malam"); Liga/Cup's screen still calls overcast "Salju".
- **Keyboard and gamepad keep their own control preset** (issue #32): Opsi > Kontrol holds one
  preset, for the device in use, and puts the other device back to its first preset when you switch.
  The server now remembers each device's last preset and restores it after Konfirmasi (the screen
  shows it the next time it opens; matches use it from kick-off).
  To see it on the screen right away when you switch, run `python tools/control_presets.py` once
  with the game closed: it patches the client's Kontrol screen (a backup is kept; `--remove` puts
  the original back).
- **The Manager menu is filled in** (issue #33): Info Manager shows your records instead of "-":
  matches, goals, wins and win streaks in League, Cup and Rank, league titles and the level reached,
  cups won and their prize money, cards bought and sold with the dearest of each, play time, and your
  intro and photo. They count from this version on. Manager Ranking shows your team value over the
  last 30 days against your 20 friends' average and ranks you among them, with each one's change
  since yesterday.
- **Missions and achievements** (issue #33): Manager > Daftar pencapaian has badge rows (manager level,
  matches, wins, upgrades, top grade, team value, goals, Rank wins), each achievement with 5 grades of
  EP, packs and items to claim and a badge to wear once a row is done, plus a daily missions row (play,
  win, score, play Rank) that resets at 00:00 WIB. The Quest button on the top bar opens the weekly
  quests (reset on Monday at 00:00 WIB) with a countdown; a finished quest pays
  GP for the window's reward boxes (EP, Lucky EP, a pack, an upgrade boost, Kotak Emas). The server
  counts the matches you play and the upgrades that succeed. The admin page's new Misi tab turns them
  on or off and sets their language (Indonesian, English, Vietnamese) and the target and reward
  multipliers; EP rewards also follow the Ekonomi tab's player prices.
- **Officials at kick-off** (issue #33): the two assistant referees were drawn from an empty record (no
  such referee in the game's list), with heads, hair and bodies that do not exist, so they looked
  deformed in the line-up. The server now names referees the game has.
- **Vietnamese commentary from an FO3 VN client** (issue #34): with the game closed, run
  `python tools/commentary.py "<FO3 VN client folder>"`. It copies the VN client's
  `audiodata\speechdata\vie_vn` next to this client's English commentary (`eng_us`) and lists only
  Vietnamese as commentary language in `data\loc\locale.big` (a backup is kept); the game then reads
  its commentary from `vie_vn`. `--remove` brings English back.
- **Random boxes open** (Kotak Platinum and the rest, issue #12): the box screen lists its prizes
  from `staticdata.availables`, which was missing, so every box failed at "Gunakan".
- **New cards join Tim Cadangan**: a card from a pack, a trade, the Market, the Bag or the admin
  page shows "-" in Skuad's Tim column, ready for Tukar Scout. Its button moves it to Tim inti
  (green RES: Tim inti outside the 18 of the squad), which can hold the whole club (200). The admin
  page can move every Tim Cadangan card to Tim inti at once.
- **Market search** finds cards of every season: the game searches only the seasons in
  `/static/roster`, which lacked 29 seasons with Market cards (World Legend, World Best,
  '14 TOTS, …), so e.g. WL R. Gullit never showed up. The Market filter's season list works
  (issue #14: picking a season threw "cannot convert 39 to Array", as each season's `value` must
  be a list) and shows the client's season names (World Legend, 02 Chinese Legend, …). It no
  longer lists the engine cards the Liga and Cup AI clubs play with ('17 badge, rated up to 127,
  e.g. L. Messi 125; they could not be bought anyway): their season 0 left `/static/roster`, whose
  "default" entry is now the client's own '17 season (88), so "2017" shows once in the season list.
- **Every tradeable card** is on the Market, in the trades and in a pack: a card counts when
  fifaaddict lists it or the game itself marks it tradeable (`permid.transferable`). fifaaddict
  alone left out 6,599 cards (4,313 of them '17); the Market now holds 44,703. The new
  **Semua Pemain** pack can give any of them.
- **Tim > Klub > Informasi tim** (issue #9) shows the start date, home stadium and "year built /
  capacity" (`coach.career`, `coach.stadium`, `GET /stadium/<id>` from the client's own stadium
  table), and its player panel (stepper, 3D player, price, grade), which stayed empty without a
  stadium. Names from the client's database read as UTF-8 (`tools/re/eadb.py` read latin-1).
- **Pack opening glow** follows the card's value: none below 10 million EP, then levels 1-3 from
  10 million, 100 million and 1 billion EP.

Known issue, not solved: with a custom EA Trax song installed by `tools/eatrax_song.py` the game
runs out of its RAssets memory pool after every match, while the Cup screen or the lobby loads
again (crash in `FifaRNA::Crowd::PlacementData::Seats[]`); with the game's own music it does not.
It crashed the same way with the song as raw PCM (37.7 MB), as EALayer3 (6.5 MB,
`tools/re/ealayer3.py`) added as a 10th track, and as EALayer3 replacing TrackID 1 with the music
bank smaller than the shipped one, so the size of the music is not the cause. Keep the game's own
music: `python -I tools/eatrax_song.py --restore` puts it back.

Not done: online play against other people (ranked PvP, friendly, King of the Hill), Road to World, league simulation.

## Requirements

- Windows, Python 3.12, `pip install cryptography` (messenger + DB extraction).
- An FO3 ID client install (default path `D:\FO3ID\32795`; elsewhere, set `FO3_GAME` to its
  folder; the server warns at startup when it cannot find the client's image cache there).
- Optional: ffmpeg (only for `tools/eatrax_song.py`).

## Setup

1. Extract the player database from your client:
   `python extract_fifadb.py D:\FO3ID\32795` → `gamedata/fifadb.sqlite`.
2. Optional market prices: `python tools/fa_sync.py` → `gamedata/fa_prices.json` (polite
   fifaaddict.com scraper; without it prices come from a rating formula).
3. TLS certificate for the client's hardcoded API host `APSEODESK172` (self-signed is accepted):

   ```
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 3650 -subj "/CN=APSEODESK172" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:APSEODESK172" -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
   python -c "open('certs/server.pem','w').write(open('cert.pem').read()+open('key.pem').read())"
   ```

4. Hosts file (as admin): `127.0.0.1 APSEODESK172`.
5. Build the launcher once (`launcher/fifalauncher.cs`, build line inside), then double-click
   **`play.bat`**: it opens the server window (`python start_all.py` = `http_config.py 443
   --tls` + `messenger.py`; close that window to stop the server) and starts the game without
   the UAC prompt.

6. By hand instead: `python start_all.py`, then start the client with the server arguments
   (what `launcher/fifalauncher.exe` and `launch_game.ps1` pass):

   ```
   fifazf.exe -QUICKMATCH/SERVER=127.0.0.1:28000 -QUICKMATCH/PROTOCOL=tcp -QUICKMATCH/NOTISERVER=127.0.0.1:28001 -FIFA/LAUNCHER/PID=<pid> -PUBLISHER/GARENA/TOKEN=testtoken -LOCALE/PUBLISHING_REGION=ID -DUMPTRUCK/SERVER=127.0.0.1 region id token testtoken
   ```

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `http_config.py` | The REST backend the client calls (`https://APSEODESK172`): login, account, coaches, club creation, squad, league, cup, market, upgrade, trades, shop, items, Bag, daily reward, static tables, and `/cdn/` (serves crests and cards from the client's own `_cache`). State lives in `gamedata/state.json`. Env: `FO3_LANGUAGE` (default `ind`), `FO3_GAME` (client folder), `FO3_ASSETS`, `FO3_HALF_LENGTH`, `FO3_ADMIN_PORT`. |
| `messenger.py` | Notification server on `:28002`. Frames `<u16 LE len><u16 type=2><Blowfish-CBC(key "kueec", IV 0) of JSON+"\n">`; answers `auth`, `ping`, `signon`. `python messenger.py --selftest`. |
| `admin.py` + `admin/index.html` | Admin page (started by `http_config.py`, localhost only, no password). Its Shop tab saves to `gamedata/shop.json`. Every word on it, error messages included, is in the `I18N` tables at the end of `admin.py`, one per language; a new language is one more table, and `python admin.py` checks that every table has the same keys. |
| `responses/` | Per-endpoint JSON bodies (`/a/b/c` → `responses/a_b_c.json`, re-read on every request). Shapes come from the client's AS3 code. |
| `extract_fifadb.py` | Client player DB (`data_0.big`, RefPack + Blowfish) → SQLite. |
| `gen_teams.py` | Starter squads and club summaries from `gamedata/fifadb.sqlite`. |
| `tools/eatrax_song.py` | Puts a song first in the game's EA Trax menu music as EALayer3, replacing TrackID 1 (edits `data_0.big` / `data_1.big` by appending; `--restore` puts the originals back). Crashes the game after matches, see the known issue. |
| `tools/fa_sync.py` | fifaaddict.com price sync. |
| `tools/fo4_season.py` | Adds FIFA Online 4's 26 LIVE and 25 LIVE cards (fifaaddict data, stats as +0) as two new seasons with FO4's season badges: `fetch`, `collect` + `import`, `build`, `install` (rewrites entries of `data_0.big` in place, as its size must not change, and appends to `Label.big`; `restore` puts both back). |
| `tools/fa_faces.py` | Adds the player mini faces missing from the client's cache (fifaaddict serves the same 128x128 PNGs); `--crests` adds the missing club crests (most clubs have none in the cache, so the game shows a default one). Resumable, `--remove` undoes it. |
| `tools/draft_icons.py` | Draws the draft packs' Shop icons (the client's cache has no draft pictures) into `assets/externalAssets/shop/`, which the server serves before the client's own images; `<icon> <tag> <picks>` draws one more, for a pack made on the admin page. Needs Pillow. |
| `tools/re/` | Reverse-engineering helpers: `bigdir.py` (BIg4 archive tables), `refpack.py` (RefPack codec), `eadb.py` (EA "DB" database tables), `abc*.py` (AS3 bytecode parser / grep / schema miner), `gfxx.py` (UI SWFs), `memgrab.py`, `dbwin.py` (the client's debug output), `relay_emu.py` (PvP relay packet codec and test relay), `gamectl.ps1` (drive the client window for tests). |
| `blaze.py`, `server.py`, `test_client.py`, `analyze_capture.py` | EA Blaze framing (Fire/TDF) and a loopback test server from the first phase of the project; the client turned out to use REST + the messenger instead. |
| `analysis/` | Early client analysis scripts (strings, PE sections, network endpoints). |
| `FO3ID-private-server.md`, `reports/` | Findings and progress reports (`reports/` is in Indonesian). |

## Tests

```
python run_tests.py
```

Runs the Blaze/loopback self-tests and `test_league.py`, which drives every backend feature
(club creation, league, cup, market, upgrade, trades, shop, daily reward, admin API, manager
delete) against a fresh account. Needs `gamedata/fifadb.sqlite`.
