"""HTTP config/publisher service stub for FO3ID.

The client requests these relative paths (found in client memory):
    /info/server/config        -> expected: server list / endpoints config
    /game/my/ipaddress         -> expected: client's public IP echo
    /publisher/garena/sign     -> publisher token sign/verify
    /publisher/nexon/2ndauth   -> secondary auth
    /telemetry/gameconnection  -> telemetry sink (can be a no-op)
    /shop/cash/charge/url, /shop/cash/history/url -> cash shop URLs

Phase 1: log every request (method, path, query, headers, body) and return a minimal
placeholder so we can see which endpoint the client hits first and what it expects.
The real response shapes are unknown until captured — every handler is a guess.

Usage: python -I http_config.py [port=8080] [--tls]
Default port 8080 to avoid colliding with a local Apache on :80.

--tls serves HTTPS with certs/server.pem. fifazf.exe calls a hardcoded
https://APSEODESK172 (port 443) for /info/server/locale etc. — no launch arg
overrides it — so run `http_config.py 443 --tls` and map APSEODESK172 to
127.0.0.1 in the hosts file.
